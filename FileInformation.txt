### File information

In this document I will give a short description what can be found in each file.

# app.py 

In app.py the main application can be found along with the entire Dash framework. Additionally, some data filtering is performed here.

# main_data.py

In main_data.py the raw data is imported and processed. app.py important the Pandas DataFrame from main_data.py.

# airport_data.py

airport_data.py creates a DataFrame from all IATA codes with relevant information, such as IATA code, name, and lat/lon data. The data is taken from a public GitHub repository.

# helper_function.py

Here, some functions are stored that help with performing certain tasks, but are moved to a separate file as they are not considered to be part of the core. This helps reduce cluttering of the core files.
