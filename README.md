<H1>AE4439 SAT Modeling project</H1>

The Air Transport Modeling project (AE4439) is one of the electives within this program that gives students the opportunity to further explore data analysis and visualization. In this report the work related to this elective will be presented, where an interactive data dashboard was developed to visualize a dataset of full-freighter cargo flights. More specifically, this dataset contains 82 MD-11F flights that depart from Flughafen Frankfurt am Main (FRA) with their destinations all across the globe. In some cases the aircraft operates a direct flight, while in other (and most) cases the aircraft operates multi-leg flights before returning to Frankfurt. As such, it must be noted that only the outbound flights from FRA have been included in this dataset. 

Moreover, this dataset with synthetically generated flights has been made available by Felix Brandt as part of his PhD thesis, under the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license. For more information the reader is kindly redirected to https://github.com/fbrandt/ACLPP.
